# Chaquopy console app

This is an example of an interactive Python console script running in an Android app using
[Chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/). Some starting points:

* The Python script is in `app/src/main/python/main.py`.
* The Android activity which hosts it is in
  `app/src/main/java/com/chaquo/python/console/MainActivity.java`.
* The Chaquopy configuration (Python version, pip requirements list, etc.) is in `app/build.gradle`.

The project currently targets Android Studio 3.0.
